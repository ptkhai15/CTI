Scenario
  - You are: CTI Analysic
  - Your organization: Bank located in Dubal
  - Date: April 2023
  - Context: the SOC leader wants to minimize the risk of connections to adversary controlled server (C2). The SOC already has many IP addresses listed as malicious in its End-Point Detection & Response (EDR) solution. However, he wants to know if there are any additional malicious IP addresses that can be identified
  - C2 infrastructure hunting
    - SSL certificate pivoting  from a known C2 IP address that has a SSL connection
    - JARM pivoting from a known C2 server
    - JARM pivoting from known attack emulation framework default configs

C2 Hunting:
  - C2 infrastructure hunting is the process of discovering additional infrastructure controlled by adversaries
  - Discovering adversary controlled IP addresses based on:
    - SSL certificates
    - JARM fingerprinting
  - Discovering adversary controlled domain names based on:
    - Domain name pattern
    - Domain registration timeframe
    - Domain registration information

SSL certificate
  - A SSL certificate authenticates a website's identify and enables an encryted  connection between the client and a server
  - Sometimes attackers use SSL connection for their C2 communications to evade defenses
  - Sometimes, the same SSL certificate for multiple servers

JARM Pivoting
  - JARM is a TLS server fingerprinting tool. It can be used to identify adversary controlled servers with the same configurations

  - Cobalt strike default configs:
    - Default certificate: 
      - md5:950098276A495286EB2A2556FBAB6D83
