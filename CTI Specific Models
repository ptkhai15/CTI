Model
- Cyber Kill Chain
  - Purpose:
    - Represent malicious activities
    - Track adversary's modus operandi evolution #Theo dõi diễn biến phương thức hoạt động của đối thủ
  - Example:
    - Recon: Valid credentials / Vulnerable Internet-facing services
    - Weaponization: Phishing email / Malicious word document
    - Delivery: Internet Protocol HTTP / HTTPS Spear-phishing email
    - Exploit: CVE-2022-42475 (Fortinet) User exploitation / User exploitation
    - Install: Cobalt Strike beacon / Scheduled task / Registry keys
    - C2: Base64 Encoded communication
    - Action on objective: Data encryption / Data theft
- Diamond Model: is a model used to represent an activity group. In each intrusion, the adversary wants to fulfill an objective by using capabilities deployed via an infrastructure against a target. Able to track activity groups. Facilitate attribution process. Able to analyze activity groups evolution. SOC data should allow CTI analysts to use diamond model to track adversaries
  - Examples:
    - Adversary uses some email, domain, ip public
    - Adversary develops Spear-phishing email with malicious link https://buy.cherry.com/...
    - email, domain, ip public deployed via Spear-phishing email with malicious link https://buy.cherry.com/...
    - email, domain, ip public connects to My organization (bank located in Dubal)
    - Spear-phishing email with malicious link https://buy.cherry.com/... exploits My organization (bank located in Dubal)
  - Purpose:
    - Represent malicious activities #Thể hiện các hoạt động độc hại
    - Track adversary's modus operandi evolution
- MITRE ATT&CK matrix: is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations
  - Example
    - https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/
  - Purpose:
    - Fcacilitate dissemination of information #Tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho việc phổ biến thông tin
- Pyramid of Pain: is a structure that helps you value the knowledge you have on a threat actor. As a defender, prioritize the top of the pyramid. Possibility to discover additional adversary infrastructure based on IP addresses and domain names
  - Overview
    - Hash values: trivial
    - Ip addresses: easy
    - Domain names: simple
    - Network/host artefacts: Annoying
    - Tools: Challenging
    - TTPs: Hard
  - Purpose:
    - Help prioritiza IoC hunting #Giúp ưu tiên săn IoC
